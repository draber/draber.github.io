## I discovered a bug / I’d like to ask for a new feature

You can report bugs or request features [here](https://github.com/draber/draber.github.io/issues). This is as fun weekend project and I don't want it to be a burden - I might work on issues from time to time but I won't make any promises. The code is available under the [GPL-3](LICENSE.md) and you can fork, modify and republish it as long as you respect the terms of the license.
